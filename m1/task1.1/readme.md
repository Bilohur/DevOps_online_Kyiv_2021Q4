During my work with git i have learned:
-creating repository and connecting it to github account;
-moving between branches;
-commiting changes in different branches;
-merging branches to master;
-resolving conflicts after merging two branches to master with its own changes;
-personal access token obtainment and adding it to local repo;
-changing default branch and remove unnecessary.
