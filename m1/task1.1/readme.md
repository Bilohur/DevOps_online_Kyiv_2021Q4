During my work with git i have learned:
creating repository and connecting it to github account;
moving between branches;
commiting changes in different branches;
merging branches to master;
resolving conflicts after merging two branches to master with its own changes;
personal access token obtainment and adding it to local repo;
changing default branch and remove unnecessary.
In my opinion DevOps is the metodology that allows to deliver IT products from developers to its destination and overcome all problems related to this.
