1.What are the most popular hypervisors for infrastructure virtualization?
The most popular hypervisors for infrastructure are Citrix XENServer, Microsoft Hyper-V, Wmware vSphere Hypervisor, KVM, KVM w/OpenStack.

2.Briefly describe the main differences of the most popular hypervisors.
There are four types of hypervisors. First runs as a control program directly on the hardware side of the computer(Hyper-v, ESX, Xen), second runs on the host operation system instead of being higher than host OS.
Others are monolithic or microkerner. Monolithic hypervisor contains drivers and virtualization stack, but microkernel don't, so it is "thinner".
